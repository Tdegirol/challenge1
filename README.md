[h1]Introduction

Challenge 1 is an assignment to refactor an existing webpage to maximize accessibility. This is a good way to practice front-end development by seeing how small changes in HTML and CSS can impact a webpage. But more importantly this is working on proper syntax, best practices, and organizing a project and publishing it through Github.
